# Authentication Flow Analysis & Recommendations

## Current Authentication Flow Map

### 1. Traditional Signup Flow
```
1. User visits /signup
2. Enters email + password
3. Backend creates user with onboarded=false
4. Frontend navigates to /onboarding with state {email, password}
5. User enters first name, last name, phone
6. Frontend navigates to /onboarding/verify with all data
7. User enters phone number, gets SMS OTP
8. User enters OTP, backend verifies and updates user with onboarded=true
9. User gets JWT token and navigates to dashboard
```

### 2. Traditional Login Flow  
```
1. User visits /login
2. Enters email + password
3. Backend checks credentials and onboarding status
4. If onboarding_required=true → redirect to /onboarding
5. If complete → return JWT token and user data
6. Frontend navigates to appropriate dashboard based on role
```

### 3. Social Login Flow (Google)
```
1. User clicks "Continue with Google" 
2. Firebase popup/redirect handles Google OAuth
3. Frontend gets Firebase ID token
4. Backend verifies token with Firebase Admin SDK
5. Backend finds/creates user with onboarded=true automatically
6. Backend checks if profile data missing → onboarding_required=true
7. If onboarding needed → redirect to /onboarding
8. If complete → return JWT token and navigate to dashboard
```

## Issues Identified

### 🚨 Critical Issues

1. **Inconsistent Onboarding Logic**
   - Traditional signup: Creates user with `onboarded=false`
   - Social login: Creates user with `onboarded=true` 
   - This causes confusion in flow determination

2. **Missing Profile Data Handling**
   - Social login users may lack first_name, last_name, phone
   - Current logic only checks name fields but phone verification still needed
   - No clear UX for completing missing social profile data

3. **Phone Verification Bypass in Social Login**
   - Social users get `onboarded=true` but may not have verified phone
   - Phone verification is critical for loyalty program features
   - Security risk: unverified phone numbers in system

4. **Inconsistent Navigation Logic**
   - Different paths for different user types
   - No clear "next step" guidance for partially completed profiles
   - Social users with incomplete profiles get confusing flow

### ⚠️ UX Issues

5. **Duplicate Onboarding Pages**
   - `/pages/Onboarding.tsx` and `/features/auth/pages/Onboarding.tsx`
   - Routes reference different files causing confusion
   - Code duplication and maintenance issues

6. **Session State Management**
   - OTP verification relies on global `confirmationRef`
   - localStorage fallback for onboarding data
   - Fragile state management across page reloads

7. **Error Handling Inconsistencies**
   - Different error messages for same scenarios
   - No retry mechanisms for network failures in all flows
   - Unclear guidance when onboarding fails

### 🔧 Technical Debt

8. **Backend Response Inconsistencies**
   - `/auth/login` returns full `LoginResponse` with onboarding flags
   - `/auth/social-login` returns same schema but logic differs
   - `/auth/confirm-otp` returns simple token without user data

9. **Role-Based Navigation**
   - Hardcoded navigation logic in multiple places
   - No centralized role-based routing
   - Staff/admin users mixed with regular user flows

10. **Firebase Integration Issues**
    - Phone verification not integrated with backend user creation
    - Firebase users may exist without backend counterparts
    - No cleanup of failed Firebase auth attempts

## Recommended Solutions

### Phase 1: Standardize Onboarding Logic

1. **Unified Onboarding Status**
   ```typescript
   interface OnboardingStatus {
     profile_complete: boolean;    // first_name, last_name exist
     phone_verified: boolean;      // phone exists and verified
     onboarding_complete: boolean; // both above = true
   }
   ```

2. **Backend Response Standardization**
   ```typescript
   interface AuthResponse {
     access_token: string;
     user: UserData;
     onboarding: OnboardingStatus;
     next_step: 'PROFILE_INFO' | 'PHONE_VERIFICATION' | 'COMPLETE' | null;
   }
   ```

3. **Consolidate Onboarding Flow**
   - Single `/onboarding` route with step-based navigation
   - Unified component handling all onboarding scenarios
   - Clear progression: Profile → Phone → Complete

### Phase 2: Fix Social Login Flow

1. **Social User Creation Logic**
   ```python
   # In social-login endpoint
   if not user:
       user = User(
           email=email,
           onboarded=False,  # Force onboarding for profile completion
           created_at=datetime.utcnow(),
           tenant_id="default",
           role="user",
       )
   ```

2. **Profile Completion for Social Users**
   - Social users must complete profile even if they have Google name
   - Phone verification required for all users
   - Consistent onboarding experience regardless of signup method

### Phase 3: Improve UX Flow

1. **Smart Navigation**
   ```typescript
   const getNextStep = (user: User, onboarding: OnboardingStatus) => {
     if (!onboarding.profile_complete) return '/onboarding/profile';
     if (!onboarding.phone_verified) return '/onboarding/phone';
     return '/dashboard';
   }
   ```

2. **Session Recovery**
   - Implement robust session recovery for interrupted flows
   - Clear localStorage management
   - Graceful handling of expired OTP sessions

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Retry mechanisms for network failures
   - Clear error messages with actionable steps
   - Fallback options for common failure scenarios

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Fix Immediately)
- [ ] Standardize onboarding logic in backend
- [ ] Fix social login user creation to require onboarding
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate onboarding components
- [ ] Add phone verification requirement for all users

### Medium Priority (Next Sprint)
- [ ] Implement unified onboarding status tracking
- [ ] Add smart navigation based on completion status
- [ ] Improve error handling and recovery flows
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing for all auth scenarios

- [ ] Performance optimizations for auth flows
- [ ] Enhanced security measures

## Test Scenarios Needed

1. **New Traditional User**
   - Signup → Profile → Phone → Complete → Dashboard

2. **New Social User** 
   - Google login → Profile completion → Phone verification → Dashboard

3. **Returning Incomplete User**
   - Login → Continue onboarding from last step → Complete

4. **Network Failure Recovery**
   - Test failures at each step with retry mechanisms

5. **Cross-Platform Consistency**
   - Ensure flow works on mobile and desktop
   - Test popup vs redirect OAuth flows
