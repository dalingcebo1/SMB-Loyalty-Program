# Phase 3 & 4 Frontend Performance Enhancements

Date: 2025-08-30

## Summary
Implemented Phase 3 (list virtualization) and Phase 4 (code splitting & prefetch) improvements for staff dashboard & related analytics pages.

## Phase 3: Virtualization
- Introduced `VirtualizedWashHistory` (react-window) already present; lowered activation threshold from 80 to 50 items in `CarWashDashboard` for earlier DOM reduction.
- Benefit: Large histories render constant ~50 visible row components + windowing overhead instead of unbounded list.

## Phase 4: Code Splitting & Prefetch
- Converted `WashHistory` page to lazy-load `EnhancedWashHistory` with Suspense fallback.
- Ensured analytics already lazy via `EnhancedAnalyticsLazy`.
- Added wash history prefetch (`preloadWashHistory`) triggered alongside analytics when user is on root/staff paths.
- Prefetch now warms: analytics chunk, chart vendors, wash history component.

## Additional Details
- Added delta metric visualization & new mini charts (loyalty share, top services) inside `EnhancedAnalytics` (ties into earlier Phase 2 metrics but delivered in this wave).
- Added p95 duration & slow wash count surfaced with deltas.

## Next Potential Optimizations
- Bundle size snapshot (post-build) to record KB savings.
- Conditional prefetch deferral (only after first interaction) if network is slow (navigator.connection downlink test).
- Consider splitting out rarely used admin forms further.

## Verification
- TypeScript build: No new type errors in modified files.
- Backend endpoint `/business-analytics` updated & syntactically valid (added ETag + deltas).
