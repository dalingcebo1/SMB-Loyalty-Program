Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

- Use clear and descriptive variable names.
- Write modular and reusable code.
- Include comments and documentation for complex logic.
- Follow the project's coding style and conventions.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability.
- Ensure we only run the servers when it is necessary for testing.
- Do not run the servers via npm run build and npm run dev without asking for my approval.
- Check first if we already have running backend and frontend servers and use those to test.
- Check the problems section for compilation issues instead of running build.
